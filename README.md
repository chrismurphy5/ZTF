# Following up on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) candidates with the Virgin Islands Robotic Telescope (VIRT)

## ZTF Background

ZTF uses a new robotic camera with a 47 square degree field of view mounted on the Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope. 47 degrees is an unprecendented amount of sky view! Thats the equivalent sky area of 247 full moons! With such a large field of view, ZTF will capture hundreds of thousands of stars and galaxies in a single shot.

### ZTF Science Goals
+ Active Galactic Nucleii & Tidal Disruption Events
+ Stellar Astrophyiscs
+ Cosmology with type Ia Supernovae
+ Electromagnetic, Gravitationnal Waves & Neutrinos Counterparts
+ Solar System Bodies
+ Physics of Supernovae & Relativistic Explosions 
+ Andromeda Galaxy

## Etelman Observatory & VIRT

Located in St. Thomas, USVI, the Etelman Observatory is just about ready to do high quality science with our half meter optical robotic telescope named the Virgin Islands Robotic Telescope. As you can infer from the above image, we are located in an area where there are not a lot of professional telescopes. 
Using VIRT at Etelman we are interested in following up on all of the ZTF science goals, especially Tidal Disruption Events, Stellar Astrophyiscs, Physics of Supernovae & Relativistic Explosions, and Solar System Bodies. We want to contribute to these events by following up on candidates, especially for those in portions of the sky not available to telescopes in North or South America. 


### Make Alerts Really Simple (MARS)
MARS provides access to all public alerts issued by ZTF since the start of the public alert stream on June 1, 2018. Alerts can be accessed by using the [website]('https://mars.lco.global/') or the API they have set up.

## Acessing Alerts using the MARS API 
In my python based code you can see how I have utilized the MARS API to download the most recent transient candidates from ZTF.

## Following up on Candidates using VIRT
The whole purpose of downloading the most recent transients from ZTF is so that we can follow up on them using VIRT. I put my code here for two reasons.
1. Version Control (BTW: the code is not finished yet)
2. I'd like others to be able to use the code I have written. The code is useful for others who would like to see how to use the MARS API, and also useful for finding which candidates are available to view and at what time they will be highest in the sky.
